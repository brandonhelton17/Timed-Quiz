# Timed-Quiz

This is a timed quiz written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Press the start quiz to begin. I had a couple of problems with this assignment. 
You'll notice that when you answer incorrectly that the timer freezes. 
However, if you pull up the console your accurate time left is presented. 
I also didn't get to saving the highscores to local.
